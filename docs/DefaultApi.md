OffsetDateTime postedAfter = OffsetDateTime.now(); // OffsetDateTime | The response includes financial events posted after (or on) this date. This date must be in [ISO 8601](https://developer-docs.amazon.com/sp-api/docs/iso-8601) date-time format. The date-time must be more than two minutes before the time of the request.
OffsetDateTime postedBefore = OffsetDateTime.now(); // OffsetDateTime | The response includes financial events posted before (but not on) this date. This date must be in [ISO 8601](https://developer-docs.amazon.com/sp-api/docs/iso-8601) date-time format.  The date-time must be later than `PostedAfter` and more than two minutes before the request was submitted.

String nextToken = "jehgri34yo7jr9e8f984tr9i4o"; // String | The response includes `nextToken` when the number of results exceeds the specified `pageSize` value. To get the next page of results, call the operation with this token and include the same arguments as the call that produced the token. To get a complete list, call this operation until `nextToken` is null. Note that this operation can return empty pages.
try {
    ListTransactionsResponse result = apiInstance.listTransactions(postedAfter, postedBefore, marketplaceId, nextToken);
    System.out.println(result);
} catch (ApiException e) {
    System.err.println("Exception when calling DefaultApi#listTransactions");
