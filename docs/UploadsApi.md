### Example
```java
// Import classes:
//import io.swagger.client.ApiException;
//import io.swagger.client.api.UploadsApi;


UploadsApi apiInstance = new UploadsApi();
List<String> marketplaceIds = Arrays.asList("marketplaceIds_example"); // List<String> | A list of marketplace identifiers. This specifies the marketplaces where the upload will be available. Only one marketplace can be specified.
String contentMD5 = "contentMD5_example"; // String | An MD5 hash of the content to be submitted to the upload destination. This value is used to determine if the data has been corrupted or tampered with during transit.
String resource = "resource_example"; // String | The resource for the upload destination that you are creating. For example, if you are creating an upload destination for the createLegalDisclosure operation of the Messaging API, the `{resource}` would be `/messaging/v1/orders/{amazonOrderId}/messages/legalDisclosure`, and the entire path would be `/uploads/2020-11-01/uploadDestinations/messaging/v1/orders/{amazonOrderId}/messages/legalDisclosure`. If you are creating an upload destination for an Aplus content document, the `{resource}` would be `aplus/2020-11-01/contentDocuments` and the path would be `/uploads/v1/uploadDestinations/aplus/2020-11-01/contentDocuments`.
String contentType = "contentType_example"; // String | The content type of the file to be uploaded.
try {
    CreateUploadDestinationResponse result = apiInstance.createUploadDestinationForResource(marketplaceIds, contentMD5, resource, contentType);
    System.out.println(result);
} catch (ApiException e) {
    System.err.println("Exception when calling UploadsApi#createUploadDestinationForResource");
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```
